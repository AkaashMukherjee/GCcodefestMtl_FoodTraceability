Boundaries: 

To get people in:
Government creates an extra evaluation criterium in their food safety regulatory system based on participation in 
a tokenized ecosystem for peer assesment of your food security.

To create inertia for value of tokens:
Government does a controlled buyback of tokens. The price of the token is proportionnal to the amount of money saved 
on inspection because less inspectors are sent out:
Because more transparent data shows who's doing the right stuff (upstream/prevention)
(easier to isolate where inspection is most needed, less inspections to achieve same p-value (seuil de confiance))
Easier to trace timestamps and batches of food (downstream/
recalls)


1. interface to put data into the system

2. get paid in tokens 
  for value of the data (value based on an algorithm, ratings etc...)
  verification of transactions,
Algorithm placeholder:

//execute on each node before write
function write(dataJSON) {
	//algorithm
	return dataJSON
}


3. interface for marketplace for tokens, services (maybe just for now allow to buy/sell tokens for dollars,
later allow bids for services)
